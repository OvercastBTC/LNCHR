From the Boiler and Machinery (B&M) perspective, the primary hazard is failure of the electrical infrastructure.

A robust asset integrity program coupled with thorough maintenance, and effective management of change, are essential to ensuring resilience, and reliable production.

Management, operations, and maintenance personnel have been working diligently to improve the maintenance programs and practices. Any gaps in maintenance routines are identified and reviewed for implementation. Site management and maintenance personnel should be commended for their ongoing efforts in this area.

In addition to the formal recommendations made, additional comments have been provided that also represent good loss prevention advice and should be completed.

;----------------------- Quarterly Waterflow Alarm Title ----------------------------

:*:qwft::Conduct quarterly, documented, waterflow alarm testing.

:*:qwfr::Waterflow alarms should be tested by opening the inspectorâ€™s test valves to flow water through the sprinkler system. For wet-pipe systems, use the inspectorâ€™s test connection at the extreme end of the system. For dry-pipe systems, use the hydraulic test connections at the dry-pipe valve. The waterflow alarm should activate within 90 seconds of the initial waterflow. Testing should be done only by well-trained personnel or by an inspection service to avoid unnecessary local disturbances and response by the public fire department. Following the test, the alarm monitoring company should be contacted to confirm that all test signals are received. Records of all testing should be retained for review.


;------------------ Monthly Physical Valve Inspection ---------------------------------

:*:mvit::Conduct monthly, documented, physical inspections of post-indicator valves.

:*:mvir::Monthly physical testing of post-indicator valves and wall post-indicator valves verifies that valves are open and that indicating mechanisms are properly aligned with the unitâ€™s window. Records of these inspections should be maintained on file.{Enter}Physically inspecting a valve includes:{Enter}Unlocking the valve.{Enter}Turning the hand-wheel or wrench in the fully open position direction.{Enter}Turning in the closed direction two or three turns to ensure operable condition.{Enter}Returning the valve to the full open position (feeling the spring in the shaft).{Enter}Backing off approximately one-quarter turn to relieve the strain.{Enter}Relocking the valve.

;-------------------------- Low Voltage Recs -------------------------------------

:*:mchanger::Get FM Global engineering involved during the initial planning stages (the earlier the better) for any new process or process changes, construction, roofing or roof repairs, changes in fire protection, installation of gas-fired equipment or occupancy changes.  Ideally, design documents should be reviewed early in project planning and no later than the â€˜Schematicsâ€™ design phase, before the project scope and budget are developed. Early involvement by FM Global will allow alternative solutions or recommendations to be considered before budget, scope or schedule changes are required.

;---------------------------- Lock Sprinkler Valves ----------------------------------------

:*:lvt::Lock all fire sprinkler control valves in the wide-open position.

:*:lvr::All sprinkler control valves larger than 1.5 in. should be locked in the fully open position with unbreakable locks and chains. Keys for the locks should be distributed to the personnel directly responsible for fire protection. During the risk evaluation the following valves were found unlocked.

;-------------------------- Install AS Sprinkler Protection --------------------------------

:*:installast::Install automatic sprinkler protection in

:*:installasr::Sprinkler protection should be installed in accordance with FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 2-0, Installation Guidelines for Automatic Sprinklers and FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 2-8, Earthquake Protection for Water-Based Fire Protection Systems.{Enter}Before completing any such upgrade, FM Global should be contacted to review details of the proposed plans and coordinate the design with the contractor.

;------------------------------ Annual Infrared Inspection -----------------------------------

:*:irt::Perform infrared thermographic surveys on all electrical equipment annually.

:*:irr::Infrared surveys of electrical equipment should be done only by a qualified contractor or employee. If surveys are to be completed in-house a detailed list of all equipment to be surveyed should be created so that the scope of the survey is well defined. Problems found during the survey and corrective action taken should be well documented for historic and trending purposes.

; ----------------------------------- Hot Work ----------------------------------------------

:*:hwpst::Implement the use of the FM Global Hot Work Permit System.

:*:hwpsrfm::The FM Global Hot Work Permit System should be used to monitor any cutting, welding, or other hot-work activity conducted outside areas specifically designated for hot-work operations. A formal, written policy statement should specify who has the authority to issue permits and should apply to hot work conducted by facilities personnel as well as outside contractors. Designated hot-work areas should also incorporate all appropriate precautions outlined in the Hot Work Permit System. To assist you with the implementation of the FM Global Hot Work Permit System, FM Global offers the free, online, training courses Managing Hot Work Using FM Global's Hot Work Permit System and Advancing Your Hot Work Skills at https://fmglobaltraining.skillport.com.

The following guidance is outlined in Data Sheet 5-28:

Capacitance (Internal Ohmic) Testing: (see Note 1)
Section 2.5.2 and Table 1: Capacitance testing, maintenance schedule, and other useful information.
- Capacitance, internal ohmic, internal resistance, and internal impedance, are common terms that are synonymous.
- This requires a specific type of testing equipment, and cannot be done with a standard multimeter; a multimeter will provide resistance readings, but this is not the same as internal resistance.

Capacity (Performance or Discharge) Testing: (see Note 2)
Section 2.5.2.4: Periodicity of capacity testing based on battery type, and other useful information.

Failure Modes:
Section 3.3.3 and Table 2: Provides pictures and technical detail on major failure modes of flooded/vented lead acid (VLA) batteries (e.g., sulfating).

Alternatives:
- Note 1: If all of Section 2.3.6.2 (as applicable) parameters are monitored, annual capacitance (internal ohmic) testing is acceptable. The continuously monitored parameters should match Table 1; whatever is not continuously monitored, perform at regular recommended periodicity.  
- Note 2: If all of Table 1, including internal ohmic, is performed, and some additional conditions met (detailed below), it is acceptable not to perform capacity (performance or discharge) testing, due to the battery's application.
- Must meet all of the following conditions: Baseline values are recorded at the recommended intervals; the same testing equipment is utilized throughout battery life; a prescriptive failing/failed battery replacement/capacity testing program is developed, and followed; the batteries do not support any loads other than the medium voltage switchgear, and its associated protective features.

- Section 2.3.1.1: To optimize the performance and aging rate of the batteries, maintain the battery room, or area, as close to 77°F (25°C), or temperature range specified by manufacturer, as possible.
- Section 3.3.2: Provides additional technical detail on temperature control and reduced life.
- This section also includes the critical statement: Continuous operation of batteries at elevated temperature will reduce the life by approximately 50% for every increase of 15°F (8.3°C).

Please see the data sheet for full guidance details.
